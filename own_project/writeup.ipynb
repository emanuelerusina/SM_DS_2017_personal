    "The projects seeks to identify specific genres (or alternative content features) whose effectivity in engaging users, once being presented automatically to the user at the end of a content watching session, in order to improve long-term engagement and reduce churn.\n",
    "The project seeks to predict a binary value (\"replayed\"), defined as \"1\" if the autoplayed content is watched, over subsequent sessions within the first 6 months from the original autoplay, for more than 1 hour.\n",
    "Since a relevant fraction of streams are autoplayed, and \"passive\" content discovery through autoplay accounts for a significant share of all content discoveries, improving the performance of the reco engine in this respect (even marginally) would allow for saving millions of dollars on an annual base.\n",
    "Among all of the covariates included, almost all are hypothetized to be significant; identifying whether some content categories (genres) have a significantly higher rewatch rate is the goal of the project."
